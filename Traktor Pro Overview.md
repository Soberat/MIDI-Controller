# What is Traktor Pro?

Traktor Pro is a program created by Native Instruments used by DJs all over the world. It is full of useful features and most importantly for us it features a very customizable MIDI Input/Output mapping, allowing us to both control and view almost any part of the program from our controller.

Any DJ program is composed of 3 main things:
- decks, usually two - those are parts where you load the music you're gonna play and manipulate it,
